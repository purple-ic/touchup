      Updated on 14/08/2024, created on 08/08/2024 (DD/MM/YYYY)<br />
      Applies to: TouchUp version 0.1.0
      <h3>Third-party integration</h3>
      TouchUp does not require authorization for basic usage. However,
      additional features become available if you choose to log into third-party
      services.<br />
      TouchUp stores third-party authorization tokens locally on your device.
      These tokens and any information you share with TouchUp are only shared
      with relevant services, and only for relevant functions:

      <div
        style="margin-left: 15; border-left: solid 2px gray; padding-left: 8px"
      >
        <h4>YouTube</h4>
        If you've logged in to YouTube through TouchUp, your Google token is
        stored on your device until you log out through the application.<br />
        This token is only transferred to official Google APIs and is only used
        for uploading to YouTube, or for revoking itself (TouchUp automatically
        revokes your token when you log out through the application).<br />
        TouchUp does not access nor collect any Google/YouTube user data, it
        simply allows you to upload videos.<br />
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
          >Google's own privacy policy</a
        >
        applies to any data you submit on their websites when logging in, and
        any information you provide through our YouTube upload feature.
        <br />

        Your YouTube authorization information is not saved to file locally if
        you turn off "Stay logged in to YouTube" in the app's settings.<br /><br />

        If your token is saved on your device, then it is saved to your device's
        credential manager (which differs depending on your OS). All requests
        involving your token are securely encrypted with HTTPS.

      <h3>Personal information</h3>
      TouchUp itself does not collect any information (personal or
      otherwise).<br />
      If you make use of any <b>Third-party integration</b>s (such as YouTube),
      they may collect your information. Please see their respective privacy
      policies.

      <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
      We may update this privacy policy occasionally.<br />
      Each version of the privacy policy applies specifically to certain
      versions of TouchUp, which are listed at the top of this version of the
      privacy policy. Updates will generally only involve changes to this
      section or the addition of more applicable TouchUp versions.
